Reviewed Thousands of Emails in One Week','short_des' => 'Emails belonging to Huma Abedin, a top Clinton aide, were a small share of the 650,000 messages the F.B.I. recently found. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times','content' => '<p>WASHINGTON — Out of hundreds of thousands of emails seized last month from disgraced former Representative Anthony D. Weiner, a substantial number turned out to be copies of documents already reviewed by&nbsp;<a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/f/federal_bureau_of_investigation/index.html?inline=nyt-org">F.B.I.</a>&nbsp;agents and analysts, allowing the agency to wrap up in days a review that some had feared would take weeks, if not longer.</p>

<p>The F.B.I. discovered approximately 650,000 emails on a computer that agents had seized while investigating Mr. Weiner on allegations of sexual improprieties. Some of those emails belonged to Huma Abedin, Mr. Weiner’s estranged wife and a top aide to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/hillary-rodham-clinton?inline=nyt-per">Hillary Clinton</a>.</p>

<p>As it turned out, law enforcement officials said, there was no need to review all of the emails, only Ms. Abedin’s. Those emails numbered in the thousands, and even many of those were duplicates of messages that had been looked at previously, officials said.</p>

<p>That allowed the F.B.I. to sort through the emails faster than many, including some at the agency, had expected.</p>

<p>“You can’t review 650,000 emails in eight days,” Donald J. Trump said at a rally on Sunday.</p>

<p>Maybe not, but they didn’t have to. Here’s how federal agents, in the span of a week, could pore over a huge cache of emails and once again conclude that neither Mrs. Clinton nor her aides should face charges related to her handling of classified information on a personal server. The investigation, again, is closed.</p>

<p><strong>How did the F.B.I. read 650,000 emails so quickly?</strong></p>

<p>Taking to Twitter, Michael T. Flynn, a former Army lieutenant general and top Trump adviser, declared it “IMPOSSIBLE” that the F.B.I. could have scanned 650,000 emails in eight days.</p>

</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>But that figure is misleading. When F.B.I. agents seized Mr. Weiner’s laptop, they did discover about 650,000 emails, but only some of them belonged to Ms. Abedin, agents found. They realized that her emails might be relevant to the F.B.I.’s completed investigation into Mrs. Clinton’s use of a private email server, but those were only a small subset of the total.</p>

<p><strong>So how many emails were reviewed?</strong></p>

<p>The F.B.I. has not said precisely, but officials have placed the number in the thousands.</p>

<p><strong>Reading thousands of emails in eight days still seems like a lot of work.</strong></p>

<p>That number got even smaller relatively quickly. Many of the emails were copies of messages that agents had examined earlier while investigating Mrs. Clinton and her aides. Again, it’s not clear how many were duplicates, but law enforcement officials say it was a substantial number. Filtering software can ferret out duplicates from far larger databases than Mr. Weiner’s hard drive. That could have sped up the review, because the duplicates didn’t need to be examined again, but F.B.I. employees would still have had to personally vet new emails.</p>

<p><strong>Was there classified information on the computer?</strong></p>

<p>It is not clear, but that was never the most pressing question. From the beginning, officials said it would take an extraordinary discovery to change their conclusion that nobody should face charges in the case. Prosecutors and agents knew that classified information had been improperly stored on Mrs. Clinton’s server. The F.B.I. director, James B. Comey,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/06/us/politics/hillary-clinton-fbi-email-comey.html">called it careless</a>but said it did not rise to the level of a crime. Simply finding more classified information would not, by itself, have changed that conclusion.</p>

<p>The F.B.I. has not said what was in the newly discovered emails, but records previously released under the Freedom of Information Act show that Ms. Abedin’s inbox contained mostly scheduling discussions, routine office chatter and the occasional instruction from Mrs. Clinton to print something.</p>

<p><strong>Why didn’t the government tell us this would only take a week?</strong></p>

<p>The F.B.I. was reluctant to predict how long the review would take, repeatedly trying to lower the public’s expectation that it could finish before Election Day. Even though the number of emails seemed manageable early in the week, there was a chance that agents would discover something along the way that would require extensive follow-up.</p>

<p>Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Mr. Comey assigned dozens of agents and analysts to the effort, including investigators who had originally worked on the case. Dozens worked around the clock for a week. Law enforcement officials said the review was completed Sunday morning.</p>

<p><strong>What now?</strong></p>

<p>While the F.B.I. investigation is closed, Republican members of Congress have said they will not stop looking into Mrs. Clinton’s actions. Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah, the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, has promised to investigate Mrs. Clinton and said that inquiry could take years.</p>

<p>If Democrats win control of the Senate on Tuesday, they could open an inquiry of their own — into Mr. Comey’s handling of the email investigation.</p>

<p><strong>So what was this whole week about?</strong></p>

<p>It depends on where you sit.</p>

<p>Mr. Comey’s aides say it was about preserving the F.B.I.’s credibility. Had word leaked out that the F.B.I. was reading new emails that might be related to Mrs. Clinton, they say, it would have raised suspicion that Mr. Comey had not been forthcoming when he told Congress in July that&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/07/us/politics/hillary-clinton-loretta-lynch.html">the investigation was complete</a>. Democrats and some former federal law enforcement officials say it was all about Mr. Comey, who&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/us/politics/comey-clinton-email-justice.html">ignored longstanding guidelines</a>&nbsp;and traditions and plunged the F.B.I. into the presidential race. Had he followed standard Justice Department practices and kept quiet while the F.B.I. did its work, they say, this all could have been avoided.</p>

<p>In the end, though, this was not much about Mrs. Clinton at all. The F.B.I. made its conclusion — careless, but not criminal — months ago, and nothing has changed.</p>

<p><strong>What does this mean for Mr. Comey and the F.B.I.?</strong></p>

<p>Mr. Comey has told aides that he feels no pressure to step down and has no plans to do so, with nearly seven years left in his term. Mrs. Clinton’s surrogates say it would be politically difficult for her to fire him if she is elected. And the White House said Monday that President Obama continued to have confidence in Mr. Comey. But some F.B.I. employees fear that the episode has damaged the bureau’s reputation of being nonpartisan and above the political fray.</p>

Credit Sam Hodgson for The New York Times','content' => '<p>WASHINGTON — President-elect&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/donald-trump?inline=nyt-per">Donald J. Trump</a>’s transition was in disarray on Tuesday, marked by firings, infighting and revelations that American allies were blindly dialing in to Trump Tower to try to reach the soon-to-be-leader of the free world.</p>

<p>One week after&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/09/us/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-president.html">Mr. Trump scored an upset victory</a>&nbsp;that took him by surprise, his team was improvising the most basic traditions of assuming power. That included working without official State Department briefing materials in his first conversations with foreign leaders.</p>

<p>Two officials who had been handling national security for the transition, former Representative Mike Rogers of Michigan and Matthew Freedman, a lobbyist who consults with corporations and foreign governments, were fired. Both were part of what officials described as a purge orchestrated by Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and close adviser.</p>

<p>The dismissals followed the abrupt&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/12/us/politics/trump-cabinet.html">firing on Friday of Gov. Chris Christie</a>&nbsp;of New Jersey, who was replaced as chief of the transition by Vice President-elect Mike Pence. Mr. Kushner, a transition official said, was systematically dismissing people like Mr. Rogers who had ties with Mr. Christie. As a federal prosecutor, Mr. Christie had sent Mr. Kushner’s father to jail.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/us/politics/donald-trump-administration.html"><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/11/us/politics/donald-trump-administration-1478905372015/donald-trump-administration-1478905372015-master180.jpg" /></a></p>

<h2><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/us/politics/donald-trump-administration.html">Donald Trump Is Picking His Cabinet. Here’s a Shortlist.</a></h2>

<p>Prominent American allies were in the meantime scrambling to figure out how and when to contact Mr. Trump. At times, they have been patched through to him in his luxury office tower with little warning, according to a Western diplomat who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail private conversations.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/16/us/politics/trump-transition.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=a-lede-package-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news#story-continues-1">Continue reading the main story</a></p>

<p>President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt was the first to reach Mr. Trump for such a call last Wednesday, followed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel not long afterward. But that was about 24 hours before Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain got through — a striking break from diplomatic practice given the close alliance between the United States and Britain.</p>

<p>Despite the haphazard nature of Mr. Trump’s early calls with world leaders, his advisers said the transition team was not suffering unusual setbacks. They argued that they were hard at work behind the scenes dealing with the same troubles that incoming presidents have faced for decades.</p>

<p>And Mr. Trump himself fired back at critics with a&nbsp;<a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/798721142525665280">Twitter message</a>&nbsp;he sent about 10 p.m. “Very organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions,” he wrote. “I am the only one who knows who the finalists are!”</p>

<p>The process is “completely normal,” said&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/16/us/politics/donald-trump-cabinet-rudy-giuliani.html">Rudolph W. Giuliani</a>, the former New York mayor, who emerged on Tuesday as the leading contender to be Mr. Trump’s secretary of state. “It happened in the Reagan transition. Clinton had delays in hiring people.”</p>

<p>Mr. Giuliani, who made his comments in a telephone interview, added: “This is a hard thing to do. Transitions always have glitches. This is an enormously complex process.”</p>

<p>There were some reports within the transition of score-settling.</p>

<p>One member of the transition team said that at least one reason Mr. Rogers had fallen out of favor among Mr. Trump’s advisers was that, as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, he had overseen a report about the 2012 attacks on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, which concluded that the Obama administration had not intentionally misled the public about the events there. That report echoed the findings of numerous other government investigations into the episode.</p>

<p>The report’s conclusions were at odds with the campaign position of Mr. Trump, who repeatedly blamed Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent and the secretary of state during the attacks, for the resulting deaths of four Americans.</p>

<p>Eliot A. Cohen, a former State Department official who had criticized Mr. Trump during the campaign but said after his election that he would keep an open mind about advising him,&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/EliotACohen/status/798512852931788800">said Tuesday on Twitter</a>&nbsp;that he had changed his opinion. After speaking to the transition team, he wrote, he had “changed my recommendation: stay away.”</p>

<p>He added: “They’re angry, arrogant, screaming ‘you LOST!’ Will be ugly.”</p>

<p>Mr. Cohen, a conservative Republican who served under President George W. Bush, said Trump transition officials had excoriated him after he offered some names of people who might serve in the new administration, but only if they felt departments were led by credible people.</p>

<p>“They think of these jobs as lollipops,” Mr. Cohen said in an interview.</p>

<p>Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, weighed in as well. On Tuesday, he issued a blunt warning to Mr. Trump and his emerging foreign policy team not to be taken in by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, whom Mr. Trump praised during the campaign.</p>

<p>“The Obama administration’s last attempt at resetting relations with Russia culminated in Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and military intervention in the Middle East,” Mr. McCain said.</p>

<p>Some of the early transition difficulties may reflect the fact that Mr. Trump, who has no governing experience or Washington network and campaigned as an agent of change, does not have a long list of establishment figures from the Bush era to tap. His allies suggested that might ultimately prove positive for Mr. Trump if he was able to assemble a functioning team that would bring new perspectives to his administration.</p>

<p>For advice on building Mr. Trump’s national security team, his inner circle has been relying on three hawkish current and former American officials: Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California, who is chairman of the House Intelligence Committee; Peter Hoekstra, a former Republican congressman and former chairman of the Intelligence Committee; and Frank Gaffney, a Pentagon official during the Reagan administration and a founder of the Center for Security Policy.</p>

<p>Mr. Gaffney has long advanced baseless conspiracy theories, including that President Obama might be a closet Muslim. The Southern Poverty Law Center described him as “one of America’s most notorious Islamophobes.”</p>

<p>Prominent donors to Mr. Trump were also having little success in recruiting people for rank-and-file posts in his administration.</p>

<p>Rebekah Mercer, the scion of a powerful family of conservative donors and a member of Mr. Trump’s executive transition committee, has said in conversations with Republican operatives and previous administration officials that she was having trouble finding takers for posts at the under secretary level and below, according to a person familiar with her outreach efforts. She told them that the transition team was more than a month behind schedule and on a tight timeline.</p>

<p>In another delay, Mr. Pence did not sign legally required paperwork to allow his team to begin collaborating with Mr. Obama’s aides until Tuesday evening, a transition spokesman said. Mr. Christie on Election Day signed a memorandum of understanding to put the process into motion as soon as the outcome was determined, but once he was ousted from the job, Mr. Pence had to sign a new agreement.</p>

<p>The paperwork serves as a nondisclosure agreement for both sides, ensuring that members of the president-elect’s team do not divulge information about the inner workings of the government.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Teams throughout the federal government that have prepared briefing materials and reports for the incoming president’s team are on standby, waiting to begin passing the information to counterparts on Mr. Trump’s staff.</p>

<p>As of Tuesday afternoon, officials at key agencies including the Justice and Defense Departments said they had received no contact from the president-elect’s team.</p>

<p>Some Democrats are even co-opting Mr. Trump’s language from the campaign. “Every single person in our caucus agrees the system is rigged,” said Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan.</p>

<p>Still, there will be areas of bright-line disagreement. Democrats are speaking out against Mr. Trump’s appointment of Stephen K. Bannon as his chief strategist, and will oppose his promised tax cuts for the wealthy and his vow to deport millions of illegal immigrants.</p>

<p>What is not clear is whether Mr. Trump will hew to his stated agenda or turn it over to Republican lawmakers who seek a far more traditional conservative program.</p>

<p>In several key states, namely Pennsylvania, Ohio and Wisconsin, Democratic Senate candidates and the party’s presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, failed to connect with middle-class voters, who gravitated instead to the populist appeals of Mr. Trump.</p>

<p>“There is an acknowledgment that it is very shortsighted to blame this loss on a letter from the F.B.I. or what states Hillary went to,” said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota. “We need to do a better job having a bold sharp focus on the economy,” she said, like the cost of prescription drugs and predatory pricing on foreign steel.</p>

<p>“It is not just being a collection of groups,” she added. “It’s talking about policies in a serious way and talking about them in a way that touches all Americans.”</p>

<p>The competing political forces were evident in Mr. Schumer’s selection of a leadership slate that reflects competing strains within the party, from Senators<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/us/elections/bernie-sanders-on-the-issues.html?inline=nyt-per">&nbsp;Bernie Sanders</a>&nbsp;of Vermont and<a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/w/elizabeth_warren/index.html?inline=nyt-per">&nbsp;Elizabeth Warren</a>&nbsp;of Massachusetts, the best-known figures in the progressive wing, to Senator<a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/joe_manchin_iii/index.html?inline=nyt-per">Joe Manchin III</a>&nbsp;of West Virginia, one of a half-dozen moderate Democrats up for re-election in 2018.</p>

<p>“This team is ideologically and geographically diverse, it mixes the wisdom of experience with the vigor of youth, at least in Senate years,” Mr. Schumer said.</p>
